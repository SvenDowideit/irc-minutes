1. Review of Distribution
--------------------------------
_To get the big picture:_
The [top-level description of Distribution and the global motivation for these changes is located here](https://gist.github.com/dmp42/d27019e3be73b4deaeeb), and will be submitted as a PR soon.

#### **First Proposal:** [JSON Registry API V2](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9015)

_It would be more accurate to call this version v2.1_

##### What justifies the change over v2? 
- More complete resumable push/pull support. Can resume the upload of a layer.
- New layout helps on the caching front.
- Images can be more easily moved around.
- Helps us envision:
  - future protocols other than http.
  - storage types other than the Registry; in the future, can add S3 buckets, etc.

##### Will v2.1 be reverse-compatible with v2.0?
- There are 3 endpoints in v2 -- which are easy to alias into v2.1
 
##### Additional Comments:
- Make the Registry less specific to "file system images with layers”; instead, make capable of handling “manifest with blobs"
  - Change “image" to “manifest" and “layer" to “blob"
- Clearly document the v2 implementation
  - This is documented in the [Provenance Step 1 Proposal](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8093), but only a subset is used in production. The comments denote what is in v2.

##### Maintainer Summary:
There are 5 benefits to making this change, organized into 2 buckets:
- Major Bucket
  - Resumable Upload
- Minor Bucket (routes)
  - Can purge the cdn cache with 1 command vs 5
  - Path syntax allows up to write (for example) a 10-line nginx implementation vs 30 lines
  - Path syntax maps better to additional storage options, for example, an S3 bucket upload
  - There is an easy key scenario

**DECISIONS:**
- Move ahead on resumable push/pull; Meta recommends merging this on top of the current v2.
- Meta needs to discuss the remainder of the proposal (routes). They need to see evidence that the proposed changes in routes deliver enough value to make it worth making the change.

2. Other PRs
-----

#### **gh#8362** [Adding ability to copy just a file from container to host](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8362)

- Addresses gh#4272 [docker cp should accept a file destination](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/4272)
- This PR adds a flag; some maintainers didn’t like the idea of adding a flag.
  - This flag was added to preserve backwards compatibility with the current functionality.
  - Observation: we’ve already broken backwards compatibility, now we are flip-flopping back; we should try to avoid this.
- People like the cp syntax.

**DECISION:** This is a longer discussion on path behavior. We will deal with the flip-flop and decide the least-terrible option another time. @tibor will own the issue.

#### gh#8827 [Make `FROM scratch` a special cased 'no-base’ spec](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8827)

- This PR:
  - Makes `scratch` a reserved image name.
  - Makes `FROM scratch` a special build directive which sets the build to have no base image, causing the subsequent build command to produce an image with no parent.  
- The goal for @jlhawn is to have a way to build images which don't contain empty layers from a Dockerfile. That's not possible today if every image ever produced is going to have 511136ea... as the root image ID.

**DECISION:** We agree to not make `FROM scratch` optional, for now, because Dockerfile parser maintainers want to keep the door open to using that to detect a future "v2" syntax. @tibor volunteered to "elucidate" the rationale for past changes.
